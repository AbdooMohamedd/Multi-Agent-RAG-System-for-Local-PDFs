![Multi-Agent RAG System Banner](https://github.com/user/Multi-Agent-RAG-System-for-Local-PDFs/raw/main/doc/system-flowchart.png)

## üìã Overview

This system uses CrewAI's multi-agent architecture to enable intelligent searching and querying of local PDF documents. Perfect for researchers, students, and professionals who need to quickly extract accurate information from PDF files without the need for internet connectivity.

## üöÄ What This System Does

The Multi-Agent RAG System for Local PDFs automates the entire process of:

1. Taking user questions about PDF document content
2. Searching through PDF files using semantic search technology
3. Extracting the most relevant information related to the query
4. Generating well-formatted, comprehensive answers
5. Creating markdown documents with the results

All with just one command and a question about your PDFs!

## üîÑ Workflow

```
User Question ‚Üí PDF Search ‚Üí Content Extraction ‚Üí Answer Generation ‚Üí Markdown Document
```

1. **Input**: User provides a question about their PDF content
2. **Search**: System uses semantic search to find relevant sections
3. **Extraction**: The most pertinent information is extracted from the PDF
4. **Answer Generation**: AI generates a comprehensive, structured answer
5. **Output**: Results are saved as markdown documents

## üíª How to Run the System

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/username/Multi-Agent-RAG-System-for-Local-PDFs.git
   cd Multi-Agent-RAG-System-for-Local-PDFs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   pip install -e .
   ```

   This will install all required dependencies.

3. Set up your API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

### Usage

Run the system with a specific question:

```powershell
python -m askpdfcrew.src.askpdfcrew.main --pdf "path/to/your/document.pdf" --question "What is the main topic of this document?"
```

Or run in interactive mode to ask multiple questions:

```powershell
python -m askpdfcrew.src.askpdfcrew.main --pdf "path/to/your/document.pdf" --interactive
```

If no PDF path is provided, the system will prompt you to enter one.

## ‚úÖ Project Outputs

For each question, the system produces:

- `pdf_answer.md` - A well-formatted markdown document containing the answer to your question
